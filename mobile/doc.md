# Reasons Not to Choose Expo

While Expo is a powerful tool for building cross-platform apps, there are some limitations that might make it unsuitable for certain projects. Here are some key reasons to consider alternatives:

## 1. Need to Use a Website to Build the APK

Expo requires you to use their online build service to create Android APKs and iOS binaries. This means you need an internet connection to build your app, and the entire process relies on their servers. This could lead to slower build times or issues if their service is down, and it may not be ideal for developers who want to handle builds entirely locally.

## 2. Limited to 30 Builds Per Month

Expo’s free tier restricts you to a maximum of 30 builds per month. If you exceed this limit, you may face delays or the need to wait until the next month to continue building your app. This could be problematic for larger teams or projects with frequent build requirements.

## 3. Poor Network Linkage to APK

The network connection between Expo’s build service and the APK might not be optimal, leading to longer waiting times or potential errors during the build process. This could be an issue when needing consistent and fast build times for continuous integration or rapid app deployment.

These reasons may make Expo less appealing if you need more control over the build process, want faster or local builds, or have a larger volume of builds.

## Conclusion

This is why we dont want to use expo for this project
